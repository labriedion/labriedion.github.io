I manage a Microscopy Core Facility in the Douglas Hospital Research Center in Montreal. I take care of all aspects of the facility, including developing new analysis tools for my users.

### Background

Previously, I completed a BSc in Biology and a Masters in Neurobiology in Université Laval in Quebec City. After my Master's, I worked as a research assistant in a Biophotonics lab where I studied protein interactions using fluorescence microscopy and automated image analysis. I also wrote and taught the online class Introduction to Biophotonics, at Université Laval in Quebec City.
